<p>Once upon a time, there was a rabbit who was known for his speed. 
He loved boasting about how fast he could run and would often make fun of other animals for being slow. 
One day, he came across a tortoise who was minding its own business. <br/>
Mocking the tortoise, the rabbit said, “You are so slow! I bet I could beat you in a race without even trying.” <br/>
The tortoise, wise and composed, replied, “I may be slow, but I am determined. If you are up for a race, let’s give it a try.”</p>

<p>Excited to prove his speed, the rabbit agreed and the race began. The rabbit zoomed ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. Confident of his victory, the rabbit decided to take a nap under a shady tree since he was so far ahead. <br/>
Meanwhile, the tortoise kept plodding along steadily, never losing sight of the finish line. Slowly and steadily, he made progress. When the rabbit woke up, he was surprised to see the tortoise nearing the finish line.
With a burst of energy, the rabbit sprinted towards the finish line, but it was too late. The tortoise had already crossed it.
<br/>The rabbit was shocked and realized that his overconfidence had cost him the race. He admitted his mistake and learned an important lesson about patience, determination, and not underestimating others.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Moral of the story: Slow and steady wins the race. It’s not always about being the fastest, but about staying focused, determined, and never underestimating the abilities of others.</p>
